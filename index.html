          <p class="faq-text">
            If you have a Mejuri account, simply log in and select “My Orders”
            in the drop-down menu under your name. There, you can find the order
            number! If you haven't created an account, no worries! You can
            create one anytime with the same email address used to place the
            order.

          <h3 class="faq-title">Can I cancel or update my order?</h3>
          <p class="faq-text">
            If you need to cancel or make a change to your order, please reach
            out within 24 hours of placing the order. Kindly note that as our
            team works hard to get your order dispatched as quickly as possible,
            we may not be able to cancel or update your order upon request. For
            monogrammed and engraved pieces, once the order is placed, we are
            not able to cancel or update the order.

          <h3 class="faq-title">Can I change my address?</h3>
          <p class="faq-text">
            Feel free to reach out to us within an hour of placing your order
            and we will try our best to accommodate the change before the order
            is processed. Kindly note that as our team works hard to get your
            order dispatched as quickly as possible, we are unable to guarantee
            the change. Once the order is shipped, Mejuri cannot change the
            address on our end but you can follow below steps to submit special
            delivery instructions to the shipping carrier.

          <h3 class="faq-title">How can I track my order?</h3>
          <p class="faq-text">
            First, log into your Mejuri account at any time and select "My
            Orders" to review your order status. Once your order is packed and
            ready to ship, you’ll receive a tracking number via email so you can
            keep an eye on its activity while it makes its way to you.
